         <p>
            We are group of Augmented Reality enthusiasts who are looking forward to gaining
            experience in AR development and network with AR professionals to learn more about the
            field. We will be hosting demos, events, guest speakers from a wide range of AR
            companies and developers to promote AR interest at the University of Minnesota.
         </p>
         <p>
            We develop cool and useful AR applications for devices such as the Microsoft Hololens
            and Google Tango. We will be hosting events such as guest speakers from all over the
            AR Industry as well as demos of our development work and those of
            other AR organizations. We will be promoting AR within Computer Science as well as its
            many applications outside of CS.
         </p>
         <p>
            We hope to spark an interest in Augmented Reality and bring people into this upcoming
            industry that will be worth $150 billion by 2020. Our activities will allow enthusists
            to see new technology that will transform the world as well as network with
            industry experts that can potentially lead to future employment.
            Students will also be able to request access to leading technology in the AR field
            for development projects.
         </p>
